# Phil IT
## General Info
Phil IT is an online education platform for those interested in learning and teaching by providing an outline and front-end design to set up your own course. The only thing the user needs to worry about is the content of their course; the website does the rest. A teacher/student will be provided with a variety of courses plus a forum where they can connect with others and find tips and shortcuts to fast track their teaching/learning journey.
    
## Motivation
From personal experience of being a student for multiple years, trying to find different resources from different teachers with different learning styles is what motivated this project. We wanted to create a platform where anyone and everyone can teach a course with their own teaching style which will match the unique learning styles of others. This platform does what a lot of online teaching courses attempt to do, but it's open to those who have been teaching for years or are just barely getting started. It combines learning with structure with the flexibility of setting your own learning/teaching pace plus interactive features to continue learning outside of the course through a forum interaction.
